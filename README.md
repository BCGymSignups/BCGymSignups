If this is your first time using GymSignup, run the GymSignup.exe file (GymSignup for Mac) by double clicking it and it will generate three files: an accesskey.txt, a userinfo.txt, and a timepreferences.txt

### There are three parts to the setup:

## Part One

1. Double click on userinfo.txt to edit the file
2. Enter your username and password for agora in the blank lines where indicated. This is required so we can log you in. The information will never leave your computer and will be protected in that file after running the program again. See our *[privacy policy](privacypolicy.txt)* for more information.
3. Save and close the file

## Part Two

1. Double click on accesskey.txt to edit the file
2. Enter your activation key in the first line. This key is valid for 1 use every day. After the key is used to book a slot, you may not use it again for that same day.
3. Save and close the file

## Part Three (Optional)

1. Double click on timepreferences.txt to edit the file
2. Enter a number representing the minimum number of hours out to sign you up for a slot in the line where indicated. This number is used by the script to determine how soon of a slot is too soon for you.
    1. For example, if I am going to an hour-long class and do not want to sign up for a gym slot within that hour, I would put a 1 in this spot.
3. Read the instructions and enter your time preferences so you can choose the day/time you prefer it to sign you up for
    1. For example, if today is Wednesday and you only want to sign up for gym slots at 10:30 am on Thursday: have __*1*__ under __*DAY PREFERENCES*__ and delete all other entries because you want a sign up for tomorrow, and then delete all times except __*10:30 am*__ to only sign up for that time.
    2. All start times are listed in that file and can be appended to, so if there is a new time you want to add, you can do so in the form hour:minute AM/PM or hour AM/PM

## Running the Program

At this point, running the program is as simple as double clicking GymSignup.exe (GymSignup on Mac) and letting it run. When the program finds a sign up time that falls within your preferences, it will attempt to sign you up for it. Upon a successful signup, the access key will be used for the today and a popup window will appear on your computer informing you of the day and time you have been signed up for.

Quick note:
- This program works and has been tested with Chrome on both Mac and Windows.  It looks for browsers in the order of preference Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.
- Not all browsers have been tested for their capability of running in the background. Chrome is the only browser that has been tested to work if it is minimized or off screen. So if you choose to use another browser, note that you must keep it open in the background or install Chrome.

You are good to go! Double click on GymSignup program and let it run in the background. You are more than welcome to click on the browser icon and watch it log you in/wait for a time slot. Pretty cool, huh? Now go and get your gains!!
