If this is your first time setup, run the BCGymSignup.exe file (BCGymSignup for Mac) and it will generate three files: an access_key.txt, a userInfo.txt, and a timePreferences.txt

### There are three parts to the setup:

## Part One

1. Double click on userInfo.txt to edit the file
2. Enter your username and password for agora in the blank lines where indicated. This is required so we can log you in. The information will never leave your computer and will be protected in that file after running the program again. See our *[privacy policy](privacy_policy.txt)* for more information.
3. Save and close the file

## Part Two

1. Double click on access_key.txt to edit the file
2. Enter your activation key in the first line. This key is valid for 1 use every day. After the key is used to book a slot, you may not use it again for that same day.
3. Save and close the file

## Part Three (Optional)

1. Double click on timePreferences.txt to edit the file
2. Enter __*weekend*__ or __*weekday*__ in the line where indicated to determine if you want the script to check Weekday AM slots or Weekday Night slots as shown in recconnect 
3. Read the instructions and enter your time preferences for each category so you can choose the day/time you prefer it to sign you up for
    1. For example, if today is Wednesday and you only want to sign up for gym slots at 10:30 am: __*weekday*__ at the top, keep __*0*__ and delete all other entries because you want a sign up for today, and then delete all times except __*10:30 am*__ to only sign up for that time.
    2. All times are listed in that file and are case sensitive, so if you are adding times back in, make sure they match that text

Quick note:
- This program works with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. It looks for browsers in the order of preference Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome.
- All browsers are capable of running in the background and have been tested for it. Chrome, however, will not work if it is minimized or off screen. So if you choose to use the Chrome version, you must keep it open in the background or install Firefox/Internet Explorer/Safari.

You are good to go! Double click on BCGymSignup and let it run in the background. You are more than welcome to click on the browser icon and watch it log you in/wait for a time slot. Pretty cool, huh!
